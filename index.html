    <h1>A Little Twitter Page</h1>

    <p>We at Chef are interested in making a front-end with standards-compliant, asyncronous, api-driven, beautious javascript. Your task is to do just that with <a
            href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1" target="_blank">Twitter's REST api</a>.

    <p>Please complete <b>any</b> number of the steps below within <b>5 days</b> of us sending you this document. You may put in as many hours as you wish, but we recommend a maximum of around 5
        hours. Use any framework and languages you would like (evidence of native JavaScript use encouraged) to complete the task. Update the repository with your solution and any steps needed to run it.

    <p>We are looking for code quality, knowledge of cross-browser compatibility, quick load times, and innovation/thoughtfulness.

    <h2>Part I: get it.</h2>

    <p>Use the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1" target="_blank">Twitter API</a> to fill the following areas on the page:

    <div style="float:left;display:inline;width:260px;background:#f4f4f4;border:1px solid #ddd;padding:220px 20px;text-align:center;font-weight:bold;margin:0 10px;">
        <p>The 30 most recent tweets from @Chef
    </div>
    <div style="float:left;display:inline;width:260px;background:#f4f4f4;border:1px solid #ddd;padding:220px 20px;text-align:center;font-weight:bold;margin:0 10px;">
        <p>The 30 most recent tweets from @laughingsquid.
    </div>
    <div style="float:left;display:inline;width:260px;background:#f4f4f4;border:1px solid #ddd;padding:220px 20px;text-align:center;font-weight:bold;margin:0 10px;">
        <p>The 30 most recent tweets from @techcrunch.
    </div>
    <div style="clear:both;"></div>
    <p>(Check out the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/statuses/user_timeline" target="_blank">User Timeline</a> API)

    <p>Each tweet should include at minimum:
    <ul>
        <li>The tweet content
        <li>A well-formatted created_at date
        <li>A link to the tweet.
        <li>For retweets and mentions, the username should be included.
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#666;"><b>Bonuses/for fun</b>: Make the columns flexible for screen width so the columns fill 100% of the page width. Layout could be as small as 320px wide. Column arrangment is
        open-ended.
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Part II: Meta</h2>

    <p>Make an "edit layout" view that has a form to change the layout settings.</p>

    <p>Use HTML5 LocalStorage to store and load the layout settings.</p>

    <p>Configurable settings could possibly include:
    <ul>
        <li>The order of the columns.
        <li>The time range of the tweets shown.
        <li>The number of tweets shown in each column.
        <li>The overall palette/skin of the page.
    </ul>
    <p>The "edit layout" panel can appear either on the same page as the tweets page, on its own page, or embedded within the tweets layout - whichever you would like. There should be a
        straightforward way to toggle between edit and view modes, and it should be clear to the user which mode they are currently in.

    <p class="fun"><b>Bonuses/for fun</b>: Implement any configurable settings you are inspired by or would find useful for a page to view tweets. If appropriate for that setting, use an interaction
        (like drag and drop) instead of a form field.
